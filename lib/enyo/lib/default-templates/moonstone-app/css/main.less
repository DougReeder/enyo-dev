    App-specific LESS/CSS would go here, but to make your
    application easier to maintain, you should try to
    minimize the use of custom CSS.
    
    Additionally, with moonstone you can control the theme
    and change it from dark to light if desired by simply adding
    the assignment:
    
    	@moon-theme: 'light';
